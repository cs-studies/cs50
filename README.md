CS50 Problem Sets Solutions
===

CS50 is Harvard's introduction course to computer science.

This fast-pacing course is great for newcomers to computer programming. CS50 efficiently covers the basics each professional or hobbyist programmer should at least be aware of.

The course's author Prof David J. Malan is an incredibly energetic person who has the ability to explain complex things in a simple way. The lectures contain a lot of valuable information and also a lot of fun to watch and study based on.

This repository contains **solutions** to the problem sets that were included in the 2018 / 2019 CS50 syllabus.
