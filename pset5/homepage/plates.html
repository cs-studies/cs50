            <p>The <em>theory of plates tectonics</em> was developed based on the <a href="drift.html">continental drift</a> theory.
The former states that the Earth's crust (and, actually, upper mantle) is divided into several parts - called <em>plates</em> - very slowly moving over the mantle.</p>

<p><mark>Plates consist of the Earth's crust and upper mantle.</mark> A plate may consist of a combination of oceanic and continental crusts or just of one of these crusts types. Visually, we may see that continents correspond to the plates by the shape. It can be said that <mark>the continents are the parts of the plates.</mark></p>

<p>The <strong>movement of the plates</strong> is thought to be <strong>caused by several forces:</strong></p>
<h4>Gravity</h4>
<p>On the edges between the plates, older and colder parts of the plates <strong>sink into the warmer mantle (the process is called subduction), pulling the rest of the plate's parts behind</strong>, and potentially causing mid-ocean ridges appearance.</p>

<h4>Mid-Ocean Ridges Growths</h4>
<p>A new oceanic crust is created by the formations called <em>rifts</em>. These formations are gaps between tectonic plates, with hot magma getting up through them, forming new ocean basins, and <strong>pushing the older parts of the plates to the sides</strong>.</p>

<h4>Convection Currents</h4>
<p><strong>The heating from the core</strong> melts down the lower parts of the mantle that <strong>causes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection" target="_blank">convection</a> currents</strong> in it, <strong>that pass the motion further to the plates</strong>.</p>
