No

Thank

Strange
that

It
is
strange
Maybe
it

I
doubt

SEBASTIAN
Yeah
I

On

What
Sebastian
demonstrates

Probably

you

Uh
huh
SEBASTIAN
You
don't
live
as
long
but
you
get
things
done
so
it
all
out
MIA
Oh
my
God
Just
then
they
reach
a
clearing
AND
THE
CITY
SKYLINE
APPEARS
BELOW
A
ribbon
of
lights
stretching
as
as
you
can
see
It's
the
most
romantic
sight
imaginable
They
look
at
other
A
beat
And
then
MIA
CONT'D
They
walk
on
the
lights
shimmering
behind
SEBASTIAN
Not
much
to
look
at
MIA
Agreed
I've
seen
better
And
on
that
they
SING
A
LOVELY
NIGHT
Mia
and
Sebastian
try
to
downplay
the
romanticism
of
this
setting
this
moment
being
lost
here
at
night
alone
together
atop
a
hill
the
city
glittering
before
them
It's
no
big
deal
nothing
they
haven't
seen
or
before
because
after
all
there's
no
chance
romance
between
them
Of
course
the
music
swelling
and
building
suggests
otherwise
Mia
tires
of
her
heels
a
bench
and
in
her
handbag
Sebastian
sits
beside
her
as
she
slips

on
They
look

She
moves

They
look
at

again
Still
suspicious
He
moves
again
She
moves
again
They
seem
to
be
moving
in
sync
without
their
wanting

bit
by
bit
before
our

almost
slipped
into

Sebastian
rises
Mia
rises
as
well
The
two
look
at
other
Run
back
to
the
bench
hop
atop
it
the
lights
stretch
out
like
a
magic
carpet
They
share
a
moment
share
a
look
jump
off
AND
START
REALLY
DANCING
NOW
Mia
does
a
move
Sebastian
responds
Sebastian
does
a
move
Mia
shakes
her
head
Nope
They
make
the
road
their
own
growing
more
and
more
as
surprised
as
we
are
to
that
they
can
really
dance
together
Just
as
this
starts
to
look
like
a
blossoming
romance
real
joy
peeking
through
our
two
heroes
getting
closer
and
closer
and
closer
looking
at
other
almost
giddily
a
sound
cuts
through
It's
a
CELL
PHONE
ring
Mia
and
Sebastian
turn
to
her
handbag
back
by
the
bench
Snapped
out

Mia

CONT'D
Hey
Greg
Can
you
hear
me
Yeah
I'm

She
hangs

Looks
at
Sebastian
An
awkward
silence
she
presses
her
again
Puts
it
under
her
chin
this
time
A
BEEP
can
be
heard
They
see
her
Prius

CONT'D
Ah
Great
Well

you
want

No

across

we
see

this
Revision
MIA
Into
Oh
I
my
aunt
was
an
actress
She
was
in
this
traveling
theater
company
And
there
was
this
little
library
across
the
street
from
my
house
when
I
was
growing
up
This
was
Boulder
City
Nevada
house
looked
the
same
I
was
ten
and
already
I
needed
to
get
out
And
one
day
my
aunt
flew
into
town
and
she
showed
me
the
library's
old
movie
section
We
spent
a
whole
day
watching
one
after
the
other
Bringing
Up
Baby
Notorious
Casablanca
a
beat
then
I
never
knew
the
world
was
so
big
DIRECTOR
O
S
Cut
Mia
and
Sebastian
resume
walking
Now
at
full
MIA
I
started
putting
on
plays
in
my
garage
I'd
write
the
scripts
and
print
up
programs
and
she'd
give
me
props
to
use
from
wherever
she'd
just
been
New
York
London
Paris
And
then
she'd
jet
off
again
and
I
wouldn't
hear
from
her
for
another
year
SEBASTIAN
Who
would
you
invite
to
watch
Your
parents

no

would
have
been
terrifying

Revision
They
resume

CUT
TO
A
row
of
closed

sandy
tan
against
the
bright
blue

SEBASTIAN
Cause
the
world
needs
more
lawyers
MIA
Well
it
doesn't
need
more
actresses
SEBASTIAN
You're
not
just
an
actress
MIA
What
do
you
mean
just
an
actress
SEBASTIAN
You
said
it
yourself
you're
a
child
prodigy
playwright
MIA
That
is
not
what
I
said
SEBASTIAN
You're
too
modest
to
say
it
but
it's
true
So
you
could
write
your
own
roles
Write
something
that's
as
interesting
as
you
are
MIA
Last
thing
I
wrote
was
a
stand
up
routine
for
an
open
mic
night
It
was
horrible
SEBASTIAN
All
I'm
saying
is
Louis
Armstrong
could
have
played
the
marching
band
charts
he
was
given
What
did
he
do
instead
He
made
history
MIA
Ok
I'll
stop
auditioning
and
make
history
instead
Sebastian
laughs
MIA
CONT'D
Anyway
I'm
getting
a
feeling
there's
something
I
should
tell
you
SEBASTIAN
Yeah
Revision
MIA
I
hate
jazz
Sebastian
stops
Turns
to
her
SEBASTIAN
What
does
that
mean
I
hate
jazz
MIA
It
means
when
I
listen
to
it
I
don't
like
it
SEBASTIAN
But
it's
such
a
blanket
statement
It's
like
saying
I
hate
animals
MIA
I
do
hate
some
animals
SEBASTIAN
Do
you
need
to
be
anywhere
right
now
Mia
looks
at
him
We
hear
DRUMS
A
swinging
ride

And
we're

INT
LIGHTHOUSE

an
old

JAZZ
CLUB
It's
almost
only
aged
JAZZ
CATS
here
for
Mia
and
Sebastian
watching
a
SEBASTIAN
CONT'D
Most
people
say
they
hate
jazz
because
they
don't
have
context
They
don't
get
where
it
came
from
All
these
people
packed
into
flophouses
in
New
Orleans
speaking
five
different
languages
and
jazz
was
how
they
talked
to
other
MIA
I
thought
it
was
just
Kenny
G
SEBASTIAN
What
Mia
looks
at
him
Already
knows
just
how
to
get
to
him
MIA
I
associate
it
with
facials
It's
relaxing
SEBASTIAN
It's
not
relaxing
Sid
Bechet
got
into
a
gunfight
cause
somebody
told
him
he
played
a
wrong
note
Revision
MIA
laying
it
on
thick
Right
but
it's
good
to
talk
over
Where
I
grew
up
there's
this
jazz
station
they'd
play
at
cocktail
parties
whenever
they
served
the
salami
and
cheese
SEBASTIAN
Mia
These
are
things
you
can't
unsay
She
bursts
into
laughter
Sebastian
points
to
the
band
SEBASTIAN
CONT'D
It's
not
cocktail
music
it's
a
high
wire
act
These
guys
are
performing
and
composing
and
rearranging
all
at
once
A
beat
Mia
looks
at
the
band
We
DRIFT
over
the
instruments
SEBASTIAN
CONT'D
That's
why
you
need
to
be
in
the
space
and
see
what's
at
stake
This
whole
thing
it's
dying
In
twenty
minutes
they'll
head
off
to
cut
commercial
sessions
or
do
pit
at
the
Pantages
cause
they
have
to
but
when
I
have
my
own
place
my
club
they'll
play
whatever
they
want
Mia
looks
at
Sebastian
Her
laughter
has
subsided
She
can
see
something
in
him
now
the
same
passion
he's
speaking
of
MIA
Your
club
SEBASTIAN
It's
gonna
be
the
old
Beek
I'm
getting
the
lease
back
It'll
be
perfect
He
watches
the
band
Lost
in
the
sound
Then
sincere
SEBASTIAN
CONT'D
The
world
tells
to
move
on
Says
the
music's
had
its
moment
But
I
love
it
too
much
I'm
not
moving
on
The
band
finishes
The
ride
cymbal
sizzles
in
the
air
SEBASTIAN
CONT'D
So
He
looks
at
Mia
She's
moved
Just
then
we

But

suppressing
a
newfound
giddiness
And
on
that
LIGHTHOUSE
CAFE
Mia
and
Sebastian
Wave
good

We
FOLLOW
Sebastian
He
rounds
the
corner
nears
the
Hermosa
Beach
pier
and
begins
to
SING
CITY
OF
STARS
Lifted
by
a
strange
new
feeling
a
feeling
he
wasn't
The
feeling
that
perhaps
just
perhaps
he's
falling
in
love
He
gazes
out
at
the
sea
the
purple
sky
Dances
with
an
OLD
COUPLE
then
continues
on
his
way
as
though
caught
in
a
dream
There's
an
uncertainty
in
his
singing
he's
not
sure
if
this
dream
will
sustain
But
for
now
it's
a
beautiful
feeling
The
MUSIC
simmers
down

Sebastian
SEBASTIAN
Yeah
that
that

sounds
good
A
moment
Keith
smiles
KEITH
Let's
play
see
how
it
feels
He
pulls
out
a
guitar
Cole
starts
on
drums
Keith
joins
in
Malcolm
and
Tom
follow
suit
Sebastian
listens
It
sounds
like
modern
jazz
electronic
in
feel
but
still

Sebastian
approaches
the
keyboard
Joins
slowly
one
step
at
a
time
Then
begins
playing
out
a
bit
more
his
fingers
starting
to
race
Malcolm
gives
Keith
a
look
Damn
Keith
gives
Malcolm
a
look
back
I
told
you
so
Bit
by
bit
Sebastian
eases
into
the
groove
This
isn't
so
bad
Then
Keith
moves
to
a
LAPTOP
Introduces
a
DRUM
MACHINE
SAMPLE
Sebastian
into
the
music
is
caught
off
guard
Uneasy
now
This
isn't
him
Keith
plays
a
riff
on
his
guitar
Tom
echoes
it
on
bass
then
Malcolm
on
trumpet
Now
it's
Sebastian's
turn
He
hesitates
And
then
finally
he
plays
the
riff
It
doesn't
feel
so
bad
The
guys
build
on
the
riff
Sebastian
keeps
up
with
them
trying
to
let
go
of
his
presuppositions
After
all
these
guys
can
play
The
music
builds
the
whole
thing
swelling
and
finally
CARRYING
US

Sebastian
and

sit

It's

But
you
say
you
want
to
save
jazz
How
are
you
going
to
save
jazz
if
no
one's
listening
Jazz
wouldn't
exist
if
people
hadn't
gotten
tired
of
what
they
were
listening
to
before
then
I
mean
do
you
really
think
a
bunch
of
ninety
year
olds
in
a
basement
is
the
future
of
the
form
Traditionalists
whined
when
Kenny
Clarke
started
dropping
bombs
If
traditionalists
had
their
way
we'd
still
be
playing
Dixieland
Sebastian
considers
this
As
much
as
he
might
make
a
play
of
resisting
we
can
tell
the
words
are
getting
to
him
SEBASTIAN
You're
holding
onto
the
past
But
jazz
is
about
the
future

KEITH
I
get

Last

to
no

She's
pushed
to

away
from

We

SEBASTIAN
What

MIA
I
mean

you're
going

SEBASTIAN
What
did
you
think
I
was
going
to
do
MIA
I
don't
know
I
didn't
think

would
SEBASTIAN
You
didn't
think
we'd
be
successful
MIA
No
that's
not
what
I
meant
What
I
meant
was
this

you're
going
to
be
on
the

what
years
now
SEBASTIAN
Yeah
feasibly
I
could
be
on

years
with
just
this
record
Beat
MIA
Do
you
like
the
music
you're
playing
SEBASTIAN
I
don't
know
how
that
matters
MIA
It
matters

you're
going

give
up
your
dream
to
be
on
the
road
for
years
Revision
SEBASTIAN
Do
you

This

To

SEBASTIAN
To
have
a
steady
job
MIA
Yes
I
wanted
you
to
have
a
job
so
you
could
take
care
of
yourself
and
start
your

SEBASTIAN
So
I'm
doing
that
So
why
aren't
we
celebrating

Why
aren't
you
starting

SEBASTIAN
You
said

This

to

I
can
find
something
else
that
I'm
supposed
to
do
I
left
school
to
give
it
a
shot
and
it
didn't
work
out
and
it
took
six
years
and
I
don't
want
to
do
it
anymore

But
Sebastian
isn't
giving
up
SEBASTIAN
Why
MIA
Why
what
SEBASTIAN
Why
don't
you
want
to
do
it
anymore
Mia
thinks
about
this
one
for
a
moment
MIA
Because
it
hurts
a
little
bit
too
much
Sebastian
shakes
his
head
Nope
Won't
accept
this
SEBASTIAN
I
told
them
you'd
be
there
at
five
thirty
tomorrow
I'll
swing
by
here
before
I
drive
back

eight
Either
you'll
be
outside

you
won't
With
that

How

Whenever

Mia
thinks
She
takes
a
breath
then
goes
silent

It
seems
she
might
be
unsure
what
to
do
might
even
be
about
to
choke

We
fear
she
may
botch
this
completely

My

lived
in

for

used
to
tell

these

when
I
was
growing
up
about

I
remember
she
told

she
jumped

pauses
and
then
continues
in
SONG
TRACK
AUDITION
Yes
this
audition
is
different
than
the
rest
and
the
switch
to
song
signals
just
that
Mia's
nerves
fade
away
all
the
accents
and
fakery
of
earlier
auditions
a
distant
memory
This
is
Mia
undisguised
pure
and
stark
and
beautiful
She
uses
the
story
of
her
aunt
jumping
into
the
river
to
paint
a
portrait
of
all
the
dreamers
in
the
world
all
the
people
who
are
told
they're
nuts
for
pursuing
their
passion
all
the
so
called
fools
who
take
the
plunge
She
sings
about
them
and
for
them
This
is
why
Mia
does
what
she
does
why
she
simply
has
no
choice
The
song
ends
and
we
linger
on
her
for
a

And
then
finally
SEBASTIAN
I
guess
we're
just
going
to
have
to
wait
and
see
Mia's

well
up
just
slightly
as

Revision
A
tune
just
piano
soft
and
tender
and
melancholy
A
melody
we
and
Mia
instantly
recognize
It's
Mia
and
Sebastian's
song
Mia
looks
at
Sebastian
He
looks
at
her
then
back
at
his
keys
This
is
the
most
beautiful
we've
ever
heard
his
playing
The
most
tender
and
full
of
emotion
it
has
ever
sounded
We
MOVE
CLOSER
on
Sebastian
We
recognize
this
image
It
recalls
the
of
his
dream
back
at
the
RESTAURANT
that
night
in
winter
years
ago
Gradually
as
Sebastian
plays
his
surroundings
seem
to
grow
DARKER
Slowly
subtly
at
first
with
just
shifts
in
lighting
then
a
shift
in
perspective
the
interior
of
the
club
changes
and
soon
we
find
ourselves
back
at
that
same
RESTAURANT
Back
when
Mia
laid
eyes
on
Sebastian
for
the
first
time
Within
this
fantasy
flashback
Sebastian
finishes
his
piece
We
stick
on
Mia
watching
him
as
his
Boss
talks
to
him
All
is
as
before
as
we
remember
it
And
sure
enough
Mia
approaches
Sebastian
as
he
walks
near
her
and
MIA
I
just
wanted
to
say
I
saw
your
playing
and
I
but
instead
of
brushing
past
her
Sebastian
decks
her
with
a
kiss
for
the
ages
A
BURST
OF
ORCHESTRAL
MUSIC
The
DINERS
in
the
restaurant
spin
around
to
face
Mia
and
Sebastian
and
SNAP
their
fingers
in

starts

then
strut
out
together

Sebastian
watches
Mia
perform
it's
the
night
of
her
play
He
stands
up
to
applaud
and
behind
him
the
entire
theater
utterly
packed
rises
as
well
A
huge
standing
ovation
Mia's
ROOMMATES
are
there
giddy
with
joy
as
are
LAURA
and
HARRY

INT
STUDIO
SOUNDSTAGE
DAY
NIGHT
Mia
and
Sebastian
walk
together
outside
but
now
that
we're
outside
we
realize
this
isn't
the
real
L
A
at
all
This
in
fact
is
an
L
A
that
doesn't
exist
A
painted
backdrop
L
A
just
like
the
one
we
saw
Mia
pass
by
when
parking
on
the
lot
The
old
orange
groves
and
the
gabled
rooftops
and
the
moss
covered
bungalows
and
the
ivy
decked
lamps
the
jacaranda
trees
and
the
giant
hills
and
Griffith
and
the
Santa
Monica
Pier
all
painted
all
props
all
figments
of
a
studio
backdrop
imagination
We've
entered
a
fully
fantastical
realm
the
realm
of
the
old
Hollywood
ballets
of
the
s
and
s
Everyone
DANCES
the
pedestrians
and
the
street
performers
and
the
cops
and
the
guards
AMY
BRANDT
races
up
to
Mia
seems
to
beckon
her
to
audition
We
see
the
audition
silhouetted
against
a
wall
We
don't
hear
Mia
sing
but
the
music
takes
on
the
melody
of
her
song
carrying
us
to
PARIS
Sebastian
travels
there
with
Mia
We
chart
the
journey
through
an
OLD
GLOBE
the
same
one
we
saw
Mia
use
for
her
play
a
miniature
plane
and
dissolves
the
old
Hollywood
movie
way
Finally
we
find
ourselves
looking
at
a
PAINTED
BACKDROP
of
Paris
the
same
one
Mia
used
for
her
play
The
Sacr
Coeur
and
the
Arc
de
Triomphe
and
the
Eiffel
Tower
etched
in
bright
colors
the
ornate
lampposts
and
the
cobblestones
stretching
before
us
And
then
a
sign
CAVEAU
DE
LA
HUCHETTE
We
see
a
jam
session
at
the
Caveau
a
crypt
like
jazz
club
Sebastian
plays
on
cloud
nine
We
see
a
MOVIE
SHOOT
Mia
surrounded
by
lights
and
cranes
decked
in
movie
movie
glow
We're
BACK
to
the
Caveau
The
lights
go
out
except
for
the
TRUMPETER
playing
out
a
lovelorn
solo
rim
lit
We
MOVE
in
close
on
his
horn
DIVE
into
the
bell
and
emerge
into
NIGHTTIME
PARIS
All
painted
Mia
and
Sebastian
wander
through
this
wonderland
pedestrians
frozen
around
them
Finally
they
stop
and
look
at
one
another
And
as
the
city
lights
behind
them
start
to
glitter
like
all
the
stars
of
the
galaxy
they
DANCE
Revision
This
is
the
last
time
we'll
ever
see
them
dance
and
they
seem
to
recognize
that
so
graceful
and
poised
are
their
movements
Remember
this
is
a
romance
more
perfect
than
a
real
romance
could
ever
be
We
DISSOLVE
again
to
a
projector
beam
footage
plays
on
a
screen
full
of
scratches
and
pockets
of
light
Mia
and
Sebastian
sit
down
to
watch
together
and
we
see
the
following
moments
in
brief
GLIMPSES
as
we
move
in
closer
on
the
imagery
The
first
home
Mia's
pregnancy
The
newborn
child
The
child's
first
birthday
The
child's
first
day
of
pre
school
all
dressed
up
Everything
here
glows
with
the
warmth
of
old
home
movies
These
are
memories
fluttering
by
grabbed
at
random
and
yet
all
concocted
dreamed
up
out
of
nothing
The
SCORE
continuing
to
sway
and
taking
us
right
up
to
Sebastian
and
Mia
husband
and
wife
father
and
mother
hiring
a
babysitter
because
they've
decided
to
go
out
for
a
night
at
the
movies
We're
back
to
now
The
look
here
is
unaffected
just
everyday
The
MUSIC
slightly
everything
goes
more
natural
as
this
happily
married
couple
hit
the
road
then
find
themselves
blocked
by
a
traffic
jam
then
take
a
side
route
winding
up
in
another
part
of
L
A
then
walk
down
the
street
then
hear
music
a
jazz
combo
playing
somewhere
and
step
into
a
place
that
looks
just
like
Sebastian's
club
They
sit
down
to
listen
And
then
and
this
is
how
our
imagined
montage
musical
number
ends
the
combo's
PIANIST
who
of
course
is
not
Sebastian
launches
into
Mia
and
Sebastian's
melody
and
Mia
and
Sebastian
look
at
each
other
recognizing
it
The
music
goes
full
circle
back
to
where
it
started
as
Mia
and
Sebastian
look
into
each
other's
eyes
lean
in
and
softly
but
with
all
the
love
in
the
world
KISS
Revision
WE
CUT
BACK
TO
THE
PIANO
Sebastian
has
just
finished
his
piece
We're
back
to
reality
The
audience
in
the
club
applauds
Beat
Mia
looks
at
Sebastian
Looks
away
A
moment
passes
DAVID
Do
you
want
to
stay
for
another
She's
silent
for
a
second
Then
she
looks
at
David
MIA
No
We
should
go
He
nods
They
rise
from
their
seats
and
head
for
the
exit
Just
as
they
reach
the
door
and
as
David
steps
out
Mia
turns
and
looks
back
at
Sebastian
He
looks
at
her
Their
eyes
lock
A
hint
of
a
tear
in
both
And
ever
so
subtly
for
just
a
fleeting
second
Mia
smiles
It's
the
kind
of
smile
you
could
miss
if
you
blinked
but
it's
enough
to
signal
to
Sebastian
that
she
recognized
the
melody
he
played
and
that
she
still
remembers
it
and
still
thinks
of
it
to
this
day
Then
she
walks
out
the
door
Sebastian
glances
at
his
fellow
musicians
Then
he
nods
and
they
launch
into
a
new
chart
EXT
STREET
NIGHT
It's
silent
outside
You
can't
hear
the
music
Mia
and
David
reach
their
car
They
get
in
It
pulls
out
Passing
by
Sebastian's
club
the
car
continues
on
We
stay
put
the
jazz
club
on
one
side
of
the
frame
the
lights
of
the
car
on
the
other
Those
lights
growing
smaller
and
smaller
before
finally
disappearing
into
the
big
